### Instructions
1. Create a Fork of this repository by clicking the 'Fork' button at the top-right of this page. Set the Repository Name to be 'LastNameFirstInitial-Retro-Remake' (without the quotes). For example, mine would be 'HerreraSturmD-Retro-Remake' (without the quotes). Click 'Create Fork'.

2. Use your preferred GitHub client (SourceTree, Bash, etc.) to clone your fork of the repository into your student folder under 'E:\VGD\YOUR_STUDENT_NUMBER'.

3. Open the project using Unity 2022.1.22f1. You can now begin writing and editing code.

4. We will have several lessons in class during the duration of the project, each going over a different Unity skills. You must create a remake of an arcade game in Unity using those skills. The way you implement it is up to you, but each skill must be present. If you have trouble getting started, ask a second year for advice.

5. Every day, before you leave class, commit and push to GitHub.

### Grading Procedure
1. I will do a quick evaluation for each student for each skill periodically. Based on the standards below, you will be given a score from 0 - 4 on that skill. You can get a new score on any skill at any time, your grade is never set in stone and I encourage you to try and master every single skill. Your score for each skill will be recorded until the project is due.
    - No Attempt (0): The skill was not used or attempted in any way in your project.
    - Introductory (1): Definition outlined in Skills Rubric above.
    - Developing (2): Definition outlined in Skills Rubric above.
    - Proficiency (3): Definition outlined in Skills Rubric above.
    - Advanced (4): Definition outlined in Skills Rubric above.

2. Your final grade on the project will be based on all the individual skill grades that were recorded, added together and adjusted to be worth the number of points that the project is worth (aka, each skill will be worth an equal part of your grade relative to the number of skills assessed and how many points the project is worth). For example, if a project is worth 80 points and there are 10 skills, then each skill is worth 8 points. For that skill, you will receive a percentage of 8 points based on whether you got a 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 on the scale explained above. For example, if you got a 1, you'd get 2 points for that skill (since 1/4 of 8 is 2). This will be added together to determine your final grade for the project.

3. You'll be given multiple opportunities to correct your work until submission and you can always re-submit past the due date for a better grade with no penalty. Late penalties in general are not applied to assignments, instead, your professionalism grade might take a hit for late submissions. This only applies if the initial submission is late, not any following submissions to correct your work (and sometimes accentuating circumstances occur, if you let me know in advance, I will most likely be reasonable regarding lifting penalties).

4. Your final grade for the project will be rounded to the nearest whole number.
